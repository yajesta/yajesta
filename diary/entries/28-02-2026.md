Today, I've taken the time to appreiciate how lovely humans are. It's remarkable really how compassionate humans are to one-another. Fortunately good prevails. I'm only 19 as of writing this and I really would hope I acomplish more in the not so distant future. Thankfully I believe my vision is wide and can see the unfortuante downsides of using tools such as social media.

I've thankfully also opened my vision of how fast I need to be moving.

I've also realised how lucky we really are to be alive in a mist of uncertainity.
