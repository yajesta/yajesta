I'm only 19 writing this. I'm starting to document what I have achieved at the end of every day (today is the first of many, hopefully) and properly reflect on my experiences. I do believe this will help me structure my feelings and emotions about general things within my life.

This day has helped me appreciate a lot of the good in this world. I need to move faster, act with more urgency and help those around me more. More reflecting to come.

In good news, I have passed my driving test last week and achieved a disctintion in my Information and Computer Technology (ICT) apprenticeship. Great!
