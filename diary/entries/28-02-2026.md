I'm only 19 writing this. I've started to document what I have achieved at the end of every day and properly reflect on my experiences. I do believe this will help me structure my feelings and emotions about general things within my life.

This day has helped me appreciate a lot of the good in this world. I need to move faster, act with more urgency and help those around me more. More reflecting to come.
